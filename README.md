Group API Project - Project Assessment

Our team chose to build a PetAdopter API using .NET Framework API Web Application for an n-tier architecture. 

The PetAdopter API includes four tables: Exotics - Jake, Domestics - Stacy, Shelter - Jonah, and Adopter - Andrew. 

Our team spent two days brainstorming and plotting out our project, which included: 

* Using Dbdiagram.io, we plotted out our tables and the foreign keys that would link them. 
* Using Trello, we used Agile methods to plot and plan our to do list, user stories, MVP list, 
  stretch goals, and personal to do lists as well as completion lists.
* We reviewed our proposed project with Instructor Andrew Torr using Zoom to share our Dbdiagram.io link.
* We used Instructor Andrew's advice and feedback to make adjustments to our database and planning materials.
* For the planning document, we worked together with Jonah typing to fill out the document before submission. As our project changed, 
  so did our document. Changes were made to the database structures as well as our planning schedule. We anticpate further changes
  as the project progresses.
* Using GitHub, we each created our own branches, as well as Dev and Master branches. Multiple times a day each team member pulled, pushed, 
  and merged their commits to make one cohesive API.
 

** This README is still in progress as the project progresses.
